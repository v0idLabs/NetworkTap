The Idea: Social media is an increasingly popular advertisement strategy. Companies use Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest to reach customers in the middle of browsing. However, there is one untapped space: the userâ€™s actual post.  Advertisers love word of mouth marketing, and having users post the actual ads themselves would be a great way to confuse others in their newsfeed!  This site would allow users that want to make a little extra cash to volunteer information on themselves, and advertisers to briefly hijack a post with an ad. Users get paid on a per-view basis or another method. Now, ads can reach eyeballs in new and innovative ways!
